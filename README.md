# Sasquatch PHP

Sasquatch its a **micro framework** based on the MVC 
pattern for making small web applications with
php 

This framework is not meant for large applications
, its a work in progress
project made by a **junior developer** use it at your
own risk, if by any chance you have suggestions please
let me know and dont be afraid to send me an email at 
**ben99.planetatierra@gmail.com**

## How to use 
The framework as you may guess its divided in three main parts
, the controllers, the database models, and the views. 
And also a config file 

It all starts in the index.php file within the public folder 
, all of the http requests are redirected to this file, witch initialize a controller
based on the url
